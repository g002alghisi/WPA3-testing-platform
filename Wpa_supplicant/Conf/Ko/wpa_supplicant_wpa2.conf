### *** Hostapd configuration file - Skeleton *** ###
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
#
# General information
# This file is a summary of the originail wpa_supplicant.conf file. A lot of
# settings have been ignored in order to get a more comprehensible and
# manageable configuration file, suited just for the use with WPA2-Personal mode.
# In particular, the aim is to allows the creation of an Supplicant STA on a PC
# with linux and a 802.11ac network WiFi card, and able to connect to an AP.
#
# The file is structured as follow:
# - the first half of file specifies general configuration settings, common to 
# all the connections.
# - the second specifies settings of each possible connection.
#
# This file comes from a special usage of wpa_supplicant_skeleton.conf, and
# allows to join a WPA2-Personal network.


##### ##### ##### General configuration settings ##### ##### #####

# STA netdevice name

# AP scanning/selection
# Wpa_supplicant requests driver to perform AP scanning and then uses the scan
# results to select a suitable AP (only option available with nl80211 driver).
ap_scan=1

# Passive or active scan for network connection
# - 0: Do normal scans (send out Probe Request frames) (default)
# - 1: Do passive scans.
passive_scan=0

# Driver interface parameters
# This field can be used to configure arbitrary driver interface parameters. The
# format is specific to the selected driver interface. This field is not used
# in most cases.
#driver_param="field=value"

# Country code
# The ISO/IEC alpha2 country code for the country in which this device is
# currently operating.
country=IT

# Protected Management Frames default
# This parameter can be used to set the default behavior for the ieee80211w
# parameter for RSN networks. By default, PMF is disabled unless enabled with
# the global pmf=1/2 parameter or with the per-network ieee80211w=1/2 parameter.
# With pmf=1/2, PMF is enabled/required by default, but can be disabled with the
# per-network ieee80211w parameter. This global default value does not apply
# for non-RSN networks (key_mgmt=NONE) since PMF is available only when using
# RSN.
#pmf=0

# MAC address policy default
# 0 = use permanent MAC address
# 1 = use random MAC address for each ESS connection
# 2 = like 1, but maintain OUI (with local admin bit set)
#
# By default, permanent MAC address is used unless policy is changed by
# the per-network mac_addr parameter. Global mac_addr=1 can be used to
# change this default behavior.
#mac_addr=0

##### ##### ##### Connection configuration settings ##### ##### #####

# network block
# Each network (usually AP's sharing the same SSID) is configured as a separate
# block in this configuration file. The network blocks are in preference order
# (the first match is used).

# Ssid: SSID (mandatory)
# Network name in one of the optional formats.
#
# scan_ssid:
#  - 0 = do not scan this SSID with specific Probe Request frames (default)
#  - 1 = scan with SSID-specific Probe Request frames (this can be used to
#      find APs that do not accept broadcast SSID or use multiple SSIDs;

# proto: list of accepted protocols
# - WPA = WPA/IEEE 802.11i/D3.0
# - RSN = WPA2/IEEE 802.11i (also WPA2 can be used as an alias for RSN)
# Note that RSN is used also for WPA3.
# If not set, this defaults to: WPA RSN

# key_mgmt: list of accepted authenticated key management protocols
# - WPA-PSK = WPA pre-shared key (this requires 'psk' field)
# - WPA-PSK-SHA256 = Like WPA-PSK but using stronger SHA256-based algorithms
# - SAE = Simultaneous authentication of equals; pre-shared key/password -based
#  authentication with stronger security than WPA-PSK especially when using
#  not that strong password; a.k.a. WPA3-Personal
# - OWE = Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (a.k.a. Enhanced Open)
# If not set, this defaults to: WPA-PSK WPA-EAP

# ieee80211w: whether management frame protection is enabled
# - 0 = disabled (default unless changed with the global pmf parameter)
# - 1 = optional
# - 2 = required

# auth_alg: list of allowed IEEE 802.11 authentication algorithms
# - OPEN = Open System authentication (required for WPA/WPA2)
# - SHARED = Shared Key authentication (requires static WEP keys)

# pairwise: list of accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA
# - CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# - TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# If not set, this defaults to: CCMP TKIP

# group: list of accepted group (broadcast/multicast) ciphers for WPA
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# If not set, this defaults to: CCMP TKIP WEP104 WEP40

# group_mgmt: list of accepted group management ciphers for RSN (PMF)
# - AES-128-CMAC = BIP-CMAC-128
# - BIP-GMAC-128
# - BIP-GMAC-256
# - BIP-CMAC-256
# If not set, no constraint on the cipher, i.e., accept whichever cipher the AP
# indicates.

# psk: WPA preshared key; 256-bit pre-shared key
# The key used in WPA-PSK mode can be entered either as 64 hex-digits, i.e.,
# 32 bytes or as an ASCII passphrase (in which case, the real PSK will be
# generated using the passphrase and SSID). ASCII passphrase must be between
# 8 and 63 characters (inclusive).
# Note: Separate tool, wpa_passphrase, can be used to generate 256-bit keys
# from ASCII passphrase.
