# Build folder
This folder contains built code.

## Hostapd
`hostapd` comes from the building process of the code from the official Ubuntu repository.
To obtain it the following process has been used:
1. Download the code from the Ubuntu repository by doing
```bash
apt source hostapd
```
2. Go to the `hostapd/` folder.
3. Create the `.config` file by means of the command
```bash
cp defconf .config
```
4. Check if the `.config` file contains the two following strings:
```bash
CONFIG_SAE=y
CONFIG_SAE_PK=y
```
If these are not preset, please add them.
5. Finally, execute
```bash
make
```
> It has been noted that if the `hostapd` version is equal or greater than the 2.11,
> then the `.config` file should already contains the two strings to allow the use of SAEand SAE_PK
> (this is valid for the code that can be found at [http://w1.fi/hostap.git](http://w1.fi/hostap.git)
> and [https://github.com/vanhoefm/hostap-wpa3.git](https://github.com/vanhoefm/hostap-wpa3.git)).

## SAE-PK key generator
`sae_pk_gen` comes from the building process of the code from the (unofficial) `hostapd-wpa3` repository,
owned by Mathy Vanhoef. Indeed, even though the code from the Ubuntu (version 2.10) and W1.fi repositories
both contain the file `sae_pk_gen.c`, the relative MakeFile contains errors. These have been overcome by
Vanhoef and Jouni Malinen and the fixes included in the `hostapd-wpa3` repository.<br>
To compile the program, the process is similar to the one followed for `hostapd`:
1. Download the code from the Vanhoef's repository by doing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanhoefm/hostap-wpa3.git
```
2. Go to the hostpd folder.
3. Create the `.config` file by means of the command
```bash
cp defconf .config
```
4. Check if the `.config` file contains the two following strings:
```bash
CONFIG_SAE=y
CONFIG_SAE_PK=y
```
If these are not preset, please add them (they should be already present).

5. Execute
```bash
make
```
6. Finally, execute
```bash
make sae_pk_gen.c
```

### Generate a SAE-PK key
These instructions are available at [https://github.com/vanhoefm/hostap-wpa3](https://github.com/vanhoefm/hostap-wpa3).

First generate a private key:
```
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out <key_file.der> -outform der
```
Now derive the password from it:
```
./sae_pk_gen <key_file.der> <3|5> <ssid_name>
```
The program will print a special string that starts like this:
```
sae_password=abcd-defg-hijk|pk=...
```
This string can be directly copied in the hostapd.conf file and will automatically enable WPA3 with SAE-PK.<br>
Note that:
- <key_file.der> is the derired name of the `.der` file generated by openssl;
- <3|5> is the `Sec` parameter for the SAE-PK key generation procedure (3 = weaker security, 5 = stronger security);
- <ssid_name> is specified without " ".
