# Configuration folder
In this folder, all the `hostapd.conf` files are stored.

In order to better handle them, several sub-folders have been created:
- `Skeleton/` contains frame configuration files that can be used to create personal solutions.
- `Ko/` contains personal solutions.
- `Basic/` contains configurations copied from Mathy Vanhoef (these are minimal working configurations, but are not well commented).
