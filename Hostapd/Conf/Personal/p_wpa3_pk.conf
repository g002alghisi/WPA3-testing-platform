# needs to be set to hw_mode=a. For IEEE 802.11ax (HE) on 6 GHz this needs

##### WPA/IEEE 802.11i configuration ##########################################

# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either
# WPA-PSK or WPA-RADIUS/EAP based on other configuration). For WPA-PSK, either
# wpa_psk or wpa_passphrase must be set and wpa_key_mgmt must include WPA-PSK.
# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.
# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),
# RADIUS authentication server must be configured, and WPA-EAP must be included
# in wpa_key_mgmt.
# This field is a bit field that can be used to enable WPA (IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)
# and/or WPA2 (full IEEE 802.11i/RSN):
# bit0 = WPA
# bit1 = IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2) (dot11RSNAEnabled)
# Note that WPA3 is also configured with bit1 since it uses RSN just like WPA2.
# In other words, for WPA3, wpa=2 is used the configuration (and
# wpa_key_mgmt=SAE for WPA3-Personal instead of wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK).
wpa=2

# WPA pre-shared keys for WPA-PSK. This can be either entered as a 256-bit
# secret in hex format (64 hex digits), wpa_psk, or as an ASCII passphrase
# (8..63 characters) that will be converted to PSK. This conversion uses SSID

# Set of accepted cipher suites (encryption algorithms) for pairwise keys
# (unicast packets). This is a space separated list of algorithms:
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC (CCMP-128)
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
# CCMP-256 = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC with 256-bit key
# GCMP = Galois/counter mode protocol (GCMP-128)
# GCMP-256 = Galois/counter mode protocol with 256-bit key
# Group cipher suite (encryption algorithm for broadcast and multicast frames)
# is automatically selected based on this configuration. If only CCMP is
# allowed as the pairwise cipher, group cipher will also be CCMP. Otherwise,
# TKIP will be used as the group cipher. The optional group_cipher parameter can
# be used to override this automatic selection.
#
# (dot11RSNAConfigPairwiseCiphersTable)
# Pairwise cipher for WPA (v1) (default: TKIP)
#wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP
# Pairwise cipher for RSN/WPA2 (default: use wpa_pairwise value)
rsn_pairwise=CCMP

# Optional override for automatic group cipher selection
# This can be used to select a specific group cipher regardless of which
# pairwise ciphers were enabled for WPA and RSN. It should be noted that
# overriding the group cipher with an unexpected value can result in
# interoperability issues and in general, this parameter is mainly used for
# testing purposes.
group_cipher=CCMP

# ieee80211w: Whether management frame protection (MFP) is enabled
# 0 = disabled (default)
# 1 = optional
# 2 = required

# management frames) certification program are:
# PMF enabled: ieee80211w=1 and wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-EAP WPA-EAP-SHA256
# PMF required: ieee80211w=2 and wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-EAP-SHA256
# (and similarly for WPA-PSK and WPA-PSK-SHA256 if WPA2-Personal is used)
# WPA3-Personal-only mode: ieee80211w=2 and wpa_key_mgmt=SAE

# Group management cipher suite
# Default: AES-128-CMAC (BIP)
# Other options (depending on driver support):
# BIP-GMAC-128
# BIP-GMAC-256
# BIP-CMAC-256
# Note: All the stations connecting to the BSS will also need to support the
# selected cipher. The default AES-128-CMAC is the only option that is commonly
# available in deployed devices.
#group_mgmt_cipher=AES-128-CMAC

# SAE password
# This parameter can be used to set passwords for SAE. By default, the
# wpa_passphrase value is used if this separate parameter is not used, but
# wpa_passphrase follows the WPA-PSK constraints (8..63 characters) even though
# SAE passwords do not have such constraints. If the BSS enabled both SAE and
# WPA-PSK and both values are set, SAE uses the sae_password values and WPA-PSK
# uses the wpa_passphrase value.
#
# Each sae_password entry is added to a list of available passwords. This
# corresponds to the dot11RSNAConfigPasswordValueEntry. sae_password value
# starts with the password (dot11RSNAConfigPasswordCredential). That value can
# be followed by optional peer MAC address (dot11RSNAConfigPasswordPeerMac) and
# by optional password identifier (dot11RSNAConfigPasswordIdentifier). In
# addition, an optional VLAN ID specification can be used to bind the station
# to the specified VLAN whenever the specific SAE password entry is used.
#
# If the peer MAC address is not included or is set to the wildcard address
# (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff), the entry is available for any station to use. If a
# specific peer MAC address is included, only a station with that MAC address
# is allowed to use the entry.
#
# If the password identifier (with non-zero length) is included, the entry is
# limited to be used only with that specified identifier.

# The last matching (based on peer MAC address and identifier) entry is used to
# select which password to use. Setting sae_password to an empty string has a
# special meaning of removing all previously added entries.
#
# sae_password uses the following encoding:
#<password/credential>[|mac=<peer mac>][|vlanid=<VLAN ID>]
#[|pk=<m:ECPrivateKey-base64>][|id=<identifier>]
# Examples:
#sae_password=secret
#sae_password=really secret|mac=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
#sae_password=example secret|mac=02:03:04:05:06:07|id=pw identifier
#sae_password=example secret|vlanid=3|id=pw identifier

# Enabled SAE finite cyclic groups
# SAE implementation are required to support group 19 (ECC group defined over a
# 256-bit prime order field). This configuration parameter can be used to
# specify a set of allowed groups. If not included, only the mandatory group 19
# is enabled.
# The group values are listed in the IANA registry:
# http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipsec-registry/ipsec-registry.xml#ipsec-registry-9
# Note that groups 1, 2, 5, 22, 23, and 24 should not be used in production
# purposes due limited security (see RFC 8247). Groups that are not as strong as
# group 19 (ECC, NIST P-256) are unlikely to be useful for production use cases
# since all implementations are required to support group 19.
sae_groups=19

# Require MFP for all associations using SAE
# This parameter can be used to enforce negotiation of MFP for all associations
# that negotiate use of SAE. This is used in cases where SAE-capable devices are
# known to be MFP-capable and the BSS is configured with optional MFP
# (ieee80211w=1) for legacy support. The non-SAE stations can connect without
# MFP while SAE stations are required to negotiate MFP if sae_require_mfp=1.
#sae_require_mfp=1

# SAE mechanism for PWE derivation
# 0 = hunting-and-pecking loop only (default without password identifier)
# 1 = hash-to-element only (default with password identifier)
# 2 = both hunting-and-pecking loop and hash-to-element enabled
# Note: The default value is likely to change from 0 to 2 once the new
# hash-to-element mechanism has received more interoperability testing.
# When using SAE password identifier, the hash-to-element mechanism is used
# regardless of the sae_pwe parameter value.
sae_pwe=2

# Transition Disable indication
# The AP can notify authenticated stations to disable transition mode in their
# network profiles when the network has completed transition steps, i.e., once
# sufficiently large number of APs in the ESS have been updated to support the
# more secure alternative. When this indication is used, the stations are
# expected to automatically disable transition mode and less secure security
# options. This includes use of WEP, TKIP (including use of TKIP as the group
# cipher), and connections without PMF.
# Bitmap bits:
# bit 0 (0x01): WPA3-Personal (i.e., disable WPA2-Personal = WPA-PSK and only
#	allow SAE to be used)
# bit 1 (0x02): SAE-PK (disable SAE without use of SAE-PK)
# bit 2 (0x04): WPA3-Enterprise (move to requiring PMF)
# bit 3 (0x08): Enhanced Open (disable use of open network; require OWE)
# (default: 0 = do not include Transition Disable KDE)
