### *** Hostapd configuration file - WPA2-Personal *** ###
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
#
# General information
# This file is a summary of the originail hostapd.conf file. A lot of settings
# have been ignored in order to get a more comprehensible and manageable
# configuration file, suited just for the use with WPA2-Personal mode.
# In particular, the aim is to allows the creation of an Acces Point on a PC
# with linux and a 802.11ac network WiFi card. Moreover, by means of a bridge,
# the WiFi LAN merges an Ethernet LAN, wich provides DHCP services and, where
# available, Internet connectivity too.
#
# The file is structured as follow:
# - the first half of file specifies general configuration settings and
#   settings related to the hardware configuration (freq. bands, driver, ...);
# - the second half specifies security settings (WPA and 802.11i).
#
# This file comes from a special usage of hostapd_skeleton.conf, and allows to
# create a WPA3-Personal network. Thus, some of the security settings have been
# selected in order to meet WPA2 constrains, but others can be defined as the
# user wishes.

# For nl80211, this parameter can be used to request the AP interface to be

# interface is also created.

# Country code (ISO/IEC 3166-1)
# Used to set regulatory domain, can limit available channels and transmit power.
country_code=IT

# Operation mode:
# - a = 802.11a (5 GHz)
# - b = 802.11b (2.4 GHz)
# - g = 802.11g (2.4 GHz)
# - ad = 802.11ad (60 GHz)
# For 802.11n (HT), specify band using a/g options.
# For 802.11ac (VHT), set hw_mode=a.
# For 802.11ax (HE) on 6 GHz, set hw_mode=a.
# When using ACS (see channel parameter), "any" can be used to indicate
# any supported band (supported only with drivers with offloaded ACS).
# Default: 802.11b
hw_mode=g

# Channel number
# (default: 0, i.e., not set, thus using Automatic Channel Selection)
# Please note that some drivers do not use this value from hostapd and the
# channel will need to be configured separately with iwconfig.

# bit 0 = Open System Authentication

### *** WPA2-Personal Hard settings *** ###

# Enable WPA
# - bit0 = WPA
# - bit1 = IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2, WPA3) (dot11RSNAEnabled)
# Note that WPA3 is also configured with bit1 since it uses RSN just like WPA2.
wpa=2

# WPA pre-shared keys
# Formats:
# - a 256-bit secret in hex format (64 hex digits)
# - wpa_psk
# - an ASCII passphrase (8..63 characters, converted to PSK using the SSID)

# Key management algorithms.
# The entries are separated with a space.
# WPA-PSK = WPA-Personal / WPA2-Personal
# WPA-PSK-SHA256 = WPA2-Personal using SHA256
# SAE = SAE (WPA3-Personal)
# OWE = Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (a.k.a. Enhanced Open)
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

# Cipher suites for pairwise keys (unicast packets)
# This is a space separated list of algorithms:
# - CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC (CCMP-128)
# - TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
# - CCMP-256 = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC with 256-bit key
# - GCMP = Galois/counter mode protocol (GCMP-128)
# - GCMP-256 = Galois/counter mode protocol with 256-bit key
# Group cipher suite (for broadcast and multicast frames) is automatically
# selected based on this configuration. If only CCMP is
# allowed as the pairwise cipher, group cipher will also be CCMP. Otherwise,
# TKIP will be used as the group cipher. The optional group_cipher parameter can
# be used to override this automatic selection.
# Pairwise cipher for WPA (v1) (default: TKIP)
#wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP
# Pairwise cipher for RSN/WPA2 (default: use wpa_pairwise value)
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
# Optional override for automatic group cipher selection
#group_cipher=CCMP

# Group management cipher suite
# Default: AES-128-CMAC (BIP) (only option commonly available)

# - BIP-GMAC-128
# - BIP-GMAC-256
# - BIP-CMAC-256
