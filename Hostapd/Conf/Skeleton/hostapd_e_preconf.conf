# g = IEEE 802.11g (2.4 GHz), ad = IEEE 802.11ad (60 GHz); a/g options are used
# with IEEE 802.11n (HT), too, to specify band). For IEEE 802.11ac (VHT), this
# needs to be set to hw_mode=a. For IEEE 802.11ax (HE) on 6 GHz this needs

# IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL version

# the new version number correctly (they seem to drop the frames completely).
# In order to make hostapd interoperate with these clients, the version number
# can be set to the older version (1) with this configuration value.
# Note: When using MACsec, eapol_version shall be set to 3, which is
# defined in IEEE Std 802.1X-2010.

##### RADIUS client configuration #############################################

# authentication with external ACL for MAC addresses, and accounting

# The own IP address of the access point (used as NAS-IP-Address)
own_ip_addr=127.0.0.1

# NAS-Identifier string for RADIUS messages. When used, this should be unique
# to the NAS within the scope of the RADIUS server. Please note that hostapd
# uses a separate RADIUS client for each BSS and as such, a unique
# nas_identifier value should be configured separately for each BSS. This is
# particularly important for cases where RADIUS accounting is used
# (Accounting-On/Off messages are interpreted as clearing all ongoing sessions
# and that may get interpreted as applying to all BSSes if the same
# NAS-Identifier value is used.) For example, a fully qualified domain name
# prefixed with a unique identifier of the BSS (e.g., BSSID) can be used here.
#
# When using IEEE 802.11r, nas_identifier must be set and must be between 1 and
# 48 octets long.
#
# It is mandatory to configure either own_ip_addr or nas_identifier to be
# compliant with the RADIUS protocol. When using RADIUS accounting, it is
# strongly recommended that nas_identifier is set to a unique value for each
# BSS.
#nas_identifier=ap.example.com

# RADIUS client forced local IP address for the access point
# Normally the local IP address is determined automatically based on configured
# IP addresses, but this field can be used to force a specific address to be
# used, e.g., when the device has multiple IP addresses.

##### WPA/IEEE 802.11i configuration ##########################################

# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either
# WPA-PSK or WPA-RADIUS/EAP based on other configuration). For WPA-PSK, either
# wpa_psk or wpa_passphrase must be set and wpa_key_mgmt must include WPA-PSK.
# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.
# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),
# RADIUS authentication server must be configured, and WPA-EAP must be included
# in wpa_key_mgmt.
# This field is a bit field that can be used to enable WPA (IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)
# and/or WPA2 (full IEEE 802.11i/RSN):
# bit0 = WPA
# bit1 = IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2) (dot11RSNAEnabled)
# Note that WPA3 is also configured with bit1 since it uses RSN just like WPA2.
# In other words, for WPA3, wpa=2 is used the configuration (and
# wpa_key_mgmt=SAE for WPA3-Personal instead of wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK).
wpa=2

# Set of accepted key management algorithms (WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP, or both). The
# entries are separated with a space. WPA-PSK-SHA256 and WPA-EAP-SHA256 can be
# added to enable SHA256-based stronger algorithms.
# WPA-PSK = WPA-Personal / WPA2-Personal
# WPA-PSK-SHA256 = WPA2-Personal using SHA256
# WPA-EAP = WPA-Enterprise / WPA2-Enterprise
# WPA-EAP-SHA256 = WPA2-Enterprise using SHA256
# SAE = SAE (WPA3-Personal)
# WPA-EAP-SUITE-B-192 = WPA3-Enterprise with 192-bit security/CNSA suite
# FT-PSK = FT with passphrase/PSK
# FT-EAP = FT with EAP
# FT-EAP-SHA384 = FT with EAP using SHA384
# FT-SAE = FT with SAE
# FILS-SHA256 = Fast Initial Link Setup with SHA256
# FILS-SHA384 = Fast Initial Link Setup with SHA384

# Set of accepted cipher suites (encryption algorithms) for pairwise keys
# (unicast packets). This is a space separated list of algorithms:
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC (CCMP-128)
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
# CCMP-256 = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC with 256-bit key
# GCMP = Galois/counter mode protocol (GCMP-128)
# GCMP-256 = Galois/counter mode protocol with 256-bit key
# Group cipher suite (encryption algorithm for broadcast and multicast frames)
# is automatically selected based on this configuration. If only CCMP is
# allowed as the pairwise cipher, group cipher will also be CCMP. Otherwise,
# TKIP will be used as the group cipher. The optional group_cipher parameter can
# be used to override this automatic selection.
#
# (dot11RSNAConfigPairwiseCiphersTable)
# Pairwise cipher for WPA (v1) (default: TKIP)
#wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP
# Pairwise cipher for RSN/WPA2 (default: use wpa_pairwise value)
rsn_pairwise=CCMP

# Optional override for automatic group cipher selection
# This can be used to select a specific group cipher regardless of which
# pairwise ciphers were enabled for WPA and RSN. It should be noted that
# overriding the group cipher with an unexpected value can result in
# interoperability issues and in general, this parameter is mainly used for
# testing purposes.

# ieee80211w: Whether management frame protection (MFP) is enabled
# 0 = disabled (default)
# 1 = optional
# 2 = required

# The most common configuration options for this based on the PMF (protected
# management frames) certification program are:
# PMF enabled: ieee80211w=1 and wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-EAP WPA-EAP-SHA256
# PMF required: ieee80211w=2 and wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-EAP-SHA256
# (and similarly for WPA-PSK and WPA-PSK-SHA256 if WPA2-Personal is used)
# WPA3-Personal-only mode: ieee80211w=2 and wpa_key_mgmt=SAE

# Group management cipher suite
# Default: AES-128-CMAC (BIP)
# Other options (depending on driver support):
# BIP-GMAC-128
# BIP-GMAC-256
# BIP-CMAC-256
# Note: All the stations connecting to the BSS will also need to support the
# selected cipher. The default AES-128-CMAC is the only option that is commonly
# available in deployed devices.
#group_mgmt_cipher=AES-128-CMAC

# Transition Disable indication
# The AP can notify authenticated stations to disable transition mode in their
# network profiles when the network has completed transition steps, i.e., once
# sufficiently large number of APs in the ESS have been updated to support the
# more secure alternative. When this indication is used, the stations are
# expected to automatically disable transition mode and less secure security
# options. This includes use of WEP, TKIP (including use of TKIP as the group
# cipher), and connections without PMF.
# Bitmap bits:
# bit 0 (0x01): WPA3-Personal (i.e., disable WPA2-Personal = WPA-PSK and only
#	allow SAE to be used)
# bit 1 (0x02): SAE-PK (disable SAE without use of SAE-PK)
# bit 2 (0x04): WPA3-Enterprise (move to requiring PMF)
# bit 3 (0x08): Enhanced Open (disable use of open network; require OWE)
# (default: 0 = do not include Transition Disable KDE)
