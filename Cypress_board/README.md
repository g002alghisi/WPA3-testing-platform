# Cypress Board
The board used for these tests is the Cypress CYW954907AEVAL1F.

It is highly recommended to work on a Windows PC, because on Linux there can be problems with the IDE. It is okay also to use a virtual machine (like on VirtualBox).

In addition to the IDE, a tool to read the messages from the serial interface is required. Some recommendations are
- on Ubuntu use `minicom`;
- on Widows use `Putty`.
