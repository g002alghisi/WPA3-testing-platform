Hi,
Thanks for the reply. I thought that the problem I found was related to
security. Indeed, your company claims that the ESP32 supports SAE-PK, but
actually it seems very easy to me to downgrade it to SAE, because the
transition disable doesn't work properly for SAE->SAE-PK (and this is a
required feature, accordingly the Wi-Fi standard).

Let's suppose to have a public caf=C3=A9 with a WPA3 with SAE-PK AP, for wh=
ich
the password is written on a sign. An attacker can easily create an
evil-twin (with just SAE) and induce the ESP32 to connect it. Indeed, even
though the ESP32 supports SAE-PK, it is useless if it is set in "automatic
mode" (the default mode for what I understand). The ESP32 can connect to
the real AP, but nothing will prevent it to join the rogue network (because
the transition disable seems not to be working properly, thus nothing is
preventing ESP32 to be downgraded).

If you think this is not the proper place to talk about this matter, I will
write a GitHub issue.

Let me know,
Alghisi Giovanni
