# My Project Hostapd-test
## TP-Link Archer T2U

To use the Wi-Fi donge it is necessary to install the drivers.

In general, one can follow the official guide. However, in Linux few errors arose.
The Morrowr's driver comes in hand; please visit the GitHub repo at [https://github.com/morrownr/8821au-20210708](https://github.com/morrownr/8821au-20210708) for more information.

- TP-Link devices that support WPA3 are showed [here](https://www.tp-link.com/ae/wpa3/product-list/).

### Cypress/Infineon

- PSoC6 with CYW43439 should support WPA3 R3 (got a reply from Infineon)

## Raspberry Pi 4
This folder contains information about the Wi-Fi related tests made with a Raspberry Pi 4 board, equipped with Linux raspberrypi 6.1.0-rpi4-rpi-v8 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 1:6.1.54-1+rpt2 (2023-10-05) aarch64 GNU/Linux.

- [this pdf](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-CYW4343W_Single-chip_ultra-low_power_IEEE_802.11b_g_nMAC_baseband_radio_with_integrated_Bluetooth_4.2_for_IoT_applications-ProductBrief-v03_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f6643ff542e) claims that it supports WPA3;
- reading [here](https://iotexpert.com/category/devkits/cy8ckit-062-wifi-bt/) it seems that WPA3 works, but not WPA3-R3;

### Raspberry

- [The Pi Pico W page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html) says that it uses the same Wi-Fi module, but using the `libwyc43` library; [here](https://github.com/georgerobotics/cyw43-driver/tree/195dfcc10bb6f379e3dea45147590db2203d3c7b/src) the source code is available; inspecting it, WPA3 support has not been found;
- [This article](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/11/06/wpa3/) states that probably the Pi 5 board still doesn't support WPA3.
